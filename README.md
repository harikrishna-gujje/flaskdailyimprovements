# flaskdailyimprovements

This project is developed using flask framework. This is a blog post website. which is used by users to register and login to the website to post their thoughts.
I hava added validators for the registration and login forms and flash messages wherever required.
I have used flask-wtf for creation of registration and login forms, sqlalchemy for the ORM models and inbuilt sqlite3 database for storing user credentials.
I used bootstrap for the css.
